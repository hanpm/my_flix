### Notes
I had issues with the formatting of this app! I realized that I select options such as "Use this as initial view controller" or setting the size estimation as "None."
I also struggled to commit to this repo instead of deleting and uploading again. I normally know to commit to a clone I have set up in my local computer. However for this project, I learn how to override another commit and force add commits.
